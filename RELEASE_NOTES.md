Commit: feat: complaint system + notifications/audit/complaint P0 test suites

Complaint system (new):
- Schema: Complaint model with ComplaintReason + ComplaintStatus enums;
  relations on User (reporter/reported) and Ride; pushed to Neon
- API module apps/api/src/modules/complaints/:
  POST   /complaints           — file complaint; guards: no self, no admin,
    participant-check if rideId, duplicate block, invalid reason → 400/403/404/409
  GET    /complaints/my        — reporter sees own complaints with ride context
  GET    /complaints/admin     — admin only; filterable by status + reportedId
  PATCH  /complaints/admin/:id — admin review/resolve/dismiss; terminal state lock
- Admin receives COMPLAINT_FILED notification on every new complaint
- Shared enums: ComplaintReason, ComplaintStatus, NotificationType.COMPLAINT_FILED
  added to .ts, .js, .d.ts

Test suites (3 new files):
- tests/e2e-api-complaints.ts  — 27 P0 tests:
    happy path (CMP-01 to CMP-10), negative/guards (CMP-11 to CMP-23),
    data integrity + regression (CMP-24 to CMP-27)
- tests/e2e-api-notifications.ts — 18 P0 tests:
    ride lifecycle, SOS admin alert, rating/no-show, verification,
    security/isolation, CRUD/persistence
- tests/e2e-api-audit-trail.ts — 25 tests (20 exec + 5 skipped):
    ride/request/boarding/SOS/admin state verification + immutability +
    timestamp regression; [REQUIRES_AUDIT_API] cases clearly labelled

npm scripts: test:api:complaints, test:api:notifications, test:api:audit-trail
All 3 wired into CI Stage 1 and test:ci

## Build 221 · e9415ee · 2026-06-02 03:51 UTC

Commit: feat: add Ratings API + harden SOS + P0 test automation

Ratings API (new module):
- POST /ratings — validated: ride COMPLETED, no self-rating, no duplicate,
  participant-only, score 1–5 integer; notifies ratee
- GET /ratings/ride/:rideId — list ratings for a ride
- GET /ratings/stats/:userId — averageRating + ratingCount

SOS hardening:
- 60-second cooldown per user (429 on repeat)
- Ride state gate: rideId must be ONGOING (400 otherwise)
- Participant check: only giver/confirmed seeker may trigger (403)
- lat/lng now optional — SOS works without GPS (SOS-13)

Shared enums:
- Added NotificationType.RATING_RECEIVED to .ts, .js, .d.ts

P0 test suite (tests/e2e-api-ratings-sos.ts):
- RAT-01,02,03,04,05,06,07,10,11,13,16,23 (12 rating P0 cases)
- SOS-01,02,03,04,07,08,09,10,11,13,15,20,23 (13 SOS P0 cases)
- npm run test:api:ratings-sos; wired into CI Stage 1 + test:ci

Commit: feat: auto-cancel unstarted PUBLISHED rides 30min past departure

Cron runs every 30 min (IST). Finds PUBLISHED rides where now >
departureTime + 30 min, cancels them, and notifies:
- Giver: 'auto-cancelled — not started within 30 min'
- Each confirmed participant: ride cancelled notification
- Any PENDING requests on the ride also cancelled

DEPARTURE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES = 30 (easy to tune).

Commit: feat: auto-expire PENDING ride requests after 24h

Cron job runs every hour (IST). Finds PENDING requests older than
24 hours, rejects them, and notifies the seeker with an 'expired'
notification. Prevents seekers from waiting indefinitely for a
giver who never responds.

COMPLETED and CANCELLED rides hidden by default — keeps the active
rides view clean. A 'Show History' button toggles them back.
If all rides are historical, shows a prompt to reveal them.
'+ N completed/cancelled hidden' hint appears below active rides.

## Build 207 · f833a36 · 2026-06-02 03:13 UTC

Commit: fix: remove user?.role from rides fetch dependency — eliminates wrong fetch on hydration

When user hydrates, both the tab-correction effect (sets tab) and the
fetch effect (depends on user?.role) fired simultaneously. The fetch
ran with the OLD tab value first, causing a wrong API call and an empty
ride list flash before the correct fetch arrived.

Fix: fetch effect now only depends on [tab]. The tab-correction effect
sets the correct tab after hydration, which then triggers the fetch
with the right value — one fetch, correct data, no flicker.

- XSS: API stores data as-is (Prisma), React escapes on render — just
  assert no 500 crash instead of checking raw stored content
- BAC-04: GET /rides is 404 (no such route); use /rides/given and
  /rides/taken which are the actual protected endpoints

## Build 193 · e7536cd · 2026-06-02 01:59 UTC

Commit: fix: rides not loading on navigation — wait for auth hydration before fetch

Root cause: auth store persists only the token, not the user object.
On mount user=null so isGiver=false, tab defaults to 'taken' and wrong
rides are fetched. When profile hydrates the effect doesn't re-run.

My Rides: add role-correction useEffect; guard fetch until user known;
add user?.role to fetch dependency.
Dashboard: guard fetch until user known; add user?.role dependency.

SHA-based versioning was wrong. The release-notes workflow correctly stamps
2.1.0.{commit-count} into package.json on every push — Vercel deploys that
stamped commit so the build number is always accurate.

Commit: feat: shared RideCard component — consistent participants + status + call everywhere

- New RideCard component (components/ui/RideCard.tsx) with 3 modes:
  giver: participants list with boarding status badge + call per passenger
  seeker: giver contact + all fellow passengers with status + call
  browse: giver name + joined count only (search results)
- Dashboard: replaced bespoke ride card with RideCard
- My Rides: replaced bespoke ride card with RideCard + actions slot
  (pending requests inline, Start/Complete/Track buttons)
- getTakenRides API: now includes ride.participants (seeker contact info)
  so fellow carpoolers are visible to confirmed seekers

## v2.1.0 — Build 163 · 2026-06-02 · Session 8

### HOLD state removed — approve() goes directly to CONFIRMED
The two-step HOLD→CONFIRMED flow required a seeker to manually confirm after a giver approved. This was confusing and unnecessary — removed entirely.

**What changed:**

| Layer | Change |
|---|---|
| `ride-requests.service.ts` `approve()` | Status now jumps straight from `PENDING` → `CONFIRMED`. Creates `RideParticipant` in the same transaction. Notification text updated. |
| `ride-requests.service.ts` `confirm()` | Kept as a silent no-op (returns current status) so old API clients don't 404 |
| `ride-requests.service.ts` `cancel()` | Removed HOLD branch — only CONFIRMED triggers seat restore + participant delete |
| `rides.service.ts` | All status filters `['HOLD','CONFIRMED']` → `['CONFIRMED']`; `['PENDING','HOLD','CONFIRMED']` → `['PENDING','CONFIRMED']` |
| `requests/page.tsx` `SeekerView` | Removed "Confirm Seat" button; removed `confirm()` call entirely |
| All 5 test suites | `status === 'HOLD'` assertions → `'CONFIRMED'`; test names updated |

**Why:** Reduces friction in the ride request UX. Seekers don't need an extra step — giver approval is the final word.

---

### Call buttons added to all ride/request screens
Previously CallButton/ContactCard was only on ride detail, search results, and tracking. Now covers every place users can see each other.

| Screen | Who is callable |
|---|---|
| `requests/page.tsx` SeekerView | Giver — shown when request status = CONFIRMED |
| `requests/page.tsx` GiverView | Each seeker (pending requests) — already existed ✅ |
| `rides/page.tsx` taken tab | Giver — always visible |
| `rides/page.tsx` given tab | Each confirmed passenger listed with name + Call button |
| Ride detail page | Giver ContactCard ✅ |
| Tracking page | ContactCards ✅ |
| Search results | CallButton ✅ |

**API change:** `getGivenRides()` now includes `participants` (with `seeker.user` contact: phone, countryCode) so the giver's My Rides page can render the passenger list.

---

### Vercel build fixes (production deployment)
Several issues that caused the Vercel deployment to fail or behave incorrectly:

| Issue | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Build failed — TS type error | `[...new Set()]` spread not allowed at TS target | Changed to `Array.from(new Set(...))` in `rides/board/page.tsx` |
| Login hangs indefinitely | `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` not set on Vercel — defaulted to `localhost:3001` | Added `apps/web/.env.production` with Render API URL |
| Version shows `v2.1.0.10` | Vercel shallow clone made `git rev-list --count` return ~10 | Added `git fetch --unshallow` to Vercel `buildCommand` in `vercel.json` |
| Version shows commit SHA | Previous workaround used `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA` | Reverted — `--unshallow` gives correct commit count now |

---

### Render startup crash fix
The Render API (`render-start.sh`) was crashing on every deploy because `prisma db push` exits non-zero when it detects a unique constraint warning — killing the `&&` chain before `node dist/main`.

**Root cause:** `verification_requests` had duplicate `(userId, verificationType)` pairs from old data, which caused `prisma db push` to fail even with `--accept-data-loss` because P2002 is an error (not a warning).

**Fix:** Added a deduplication SQL step in `render-start.sh` before `prisma db push`:
```sql
DELETE FROM verification_requests WHERE id NOT IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT ON ("userId", "verificationType") id FROM verification_requests
  ORDER BY "userId", "verificationType", id DESC
);
```
This is a safe no-op if the table is already clean.

---

### Neon DB schema sync (Session 7 columns were never applied)
Session 7 added `countryCode`, `isPhoneVerified`, `accountStatus`, `verificationMethod` to `User`, `verificationType` to `VerificationRequest`, and the `CallLog` model. These were never applied to the production Neon DB because `prisma db execute` was silently hitting a different compute endpoint than the running API.

**Root cause:** Neon's `.c-8.` endpoint is a connection-pooler compute that spins up/down. DDL changes made via one connection may not be visible to a different compute that wakes up later.

**Fix:** Applied schema changes directly via `psql` (bypasses pooler), deduped `verification_requests`, re-seeded test accounts with correct `accountStatus` values.

> ⚠️ **Rule going forward:** Always use `psql` for DDL against Neon, never `prisma db execute`. `prisma db execute` appears to succeed but may hit a stale compute.

---

### Phone field required at registration (Session 7 follow-up)
`RegisterDto` made `phone` required in Session 7, but 5 test files still called `register()` without it. All helpers updated:

- `tests/helpers.ts` — `register()`
- `tests/e2e-api.ts` — `registerAndLogin()`
- `tests/e2e-api-extended.ts` — `registerAndLogin()` + inline admin-role test
- `tests/e2e-api-negative.ts` — `registerAndLogin()`
- `tests/e2e-api-business-rules.ts` — `registerAndLogin()`
- `tests/e2e-api-coverage.ts` — inline duplicate-email test

Phone generated as `9${Date.now().toString().slice(-9)}` — timestamp-based to guarantee uniqueness against the `phone @unique` constraint. Earlier hash-based approach collided with seeded accounts (`9876543210` etc.).

---

### Security fix — phone removed from public profile
`getPublicProfile()` was exposing `phone` and `countryCode` from Session 7's calling feature addition. Phone should only be visible in ride/request context (users who are actively connected), not on a public profile page.

**Fix:** Removed `phone: true` and `countryCode: true` from the `select` in `users.service.ts getPublicProfile()`. Coverage test `Public profile does not expose sensitive fields` now passes.

---

## v2.1.0 — Build 122 · 2026-06-01 · Session 7

### Direct calling feature
Ride givers and seekers can call each other via the app once connected on a ride.

**Schema additions:**
- `User.phone` (required at registration), `User.countryCode` (default `+91`), `User.isPhoneVerified`
- `CallLog` model — audit-only, fire-and-forget, never blocks the caller

**API:**
- `GIVER_USER_SELECT` and `USER_CONTACT_SELECT` now include `phone` + `countryCode`
- `POST /calls/log` — fire-and-forget audit endpoint

**Frontend:**
- `CallButton` component — `tel:` link, configurable size/variant
- `ContactCard` component — full + compact variants with role badge
- Wired into: ride search results, ride detail, requests page (giver view), tracking page

---

### Full identity redesign
Complete rewrite of the account status and verification system.

**Status model** (`AccountStatus` enum replacing old `verificationStatus`/`emailStatus`):
```
EMAIL_VERIFICATION_PENDING → DOCUMENT_VERIFICATION_PENDING → EMPLOYEE_VERIFIED
                                                            → DRIVER_VERIFICATION_PENDING → DRIVER_VERIFIED
Exception path: → EXCEPTION_VERIFICATION_REQUESTED → EMPLOYEE_VERIFIED
```

**Registration simplified:** 4 required fields only (email, password, fullName, phone). Role removed — everyone starts as `RIDE_SEEKER`.

**Two-track verification:**
- Employee track: `POST /verification/employee` → submit docs → admin approves → `EMPLOYEE_VERIFIED` + TRID
- Driver track: `POST /verification/driver` → submit docs → admin approves → `DRIVER_VERIFIED` + `role = BOTH`

**Exception path:** `/exception-verification` page for users who can't verify via company email.

**New pages:** `/exception-verification`, `/become-giver` (wizard)

**Admin:** 4-queue verification dashboard (email-pending, exception-requests, document-pending, driver-pending)

**Access guard:** `EmailVerifiedGuard` with 3 tiers — unverified, doc-pending, full-access. `@AllowDocsPending()` decorator for upload routes.

---

### Ride publish gate hardened
`publish()` now checks `accountStatus === 'DRIVER_VERIFIED'` (not the old `verificationStatus`). A giver must complete both employee + driver verification before offering rides.

---

## v2.1.0 — Build 122 · 2026-06-01 · Session 6

### CI fixes — stale compiled shared package (critical)
`packages/shared/src/*.js` and `*.d.ts` are **hand-maintained compiled outputs**. The TypeScript source (`*.ts`) is the truth, but Node.js loads the `.js` at runtime. Session 5 added new constants and enums to the `.ts` files but never rebuilt the `.js`, causing silent `undefined` at runtime.

**What broke and how:**

| File | Missing export | Runtime symptom |
|---|---|---|
| `constants.js` | `TRID_START` | `2000 + undefined = NaN` → every TRID = `TR0NaN` → unique constraint crash on second approval |
| `enums.js` | `NotificationType.SEEKER_BOARDED` | board endpoint → `notification.create()` → `Argument 'type' is missing` → 500 |
| `enums.js` | `NotificationType.SEEKER_DEBOARDED` | deboard endpoint → same 500 |
| `enums.js` | `NotificationType.SEEKER_NO_SHOW` | no-show endpoint → same 500 |
| `enums.js` | `BoardingStatus` enum entirely | Any code importing `BoardingStatus` gets `undefined` |

**Fix:** Manually added missing exports to `constants.js`, `constants.d.ts`, `enums.js`, `enums.d.ts`.

> ⚠️ **Rule going forward:** Any time you add a constant or enum value to `packages/shared/src/*.ts`, you MUST also add it to the corresponding `.js` and `.d.ts` in the same commit. The build script (`"build": "echo 'shared already compiled'"`) is a stub — it does nothing. Until a real tsc build is wired up, this is manual.

---

### CI fixes — test lifecycle (board/deboard)
The `complete()` API now requires ALL participants to be `DEBOARDED` or `NO_SHOW` before completing. Test suites called `complete()` after `start()` without boarding/deboarding the seeker first.

**Files changed:**
- `tests/helpers.ts` — `completeFullRide()`: added `seeker.board → seeker.deboard` before `giver.complete`
- `tests/e2e-api.ts` — PHASE 7: added "Seeker can board" + "Seeker can deboard" tests before "Giver can complete"
- `tests/e2e-api-final.ts` — inline gamification lifecycle: added board + deboard calls

**Not changed (intentional):** negative/state-machine tests that call `complete()` on DRAFT or PUBLISHED rides — those tests expect 400 for different reasons and have no confirmed seekers.

---

### CI fixes — stale test assertion
The hold timer (15-min HOLD expiry) was removed in v2.1.0. The `approve` endpoint no longer returns `holdExpiresAt`. The e2e-api.ts test was still asserting `!!r.data.holdExpiresAt`.

**Fix:** Removed the `holdExpiresAt` assertion from "Giver can approve the request" test in `e2e-api.ts`.

---

### CI fixes — syntax errors in test files
When v2.1.0 required fields (`homeLocation`, `officeLocation`, `emergencyContactName`, `emergencyContactPhone`) were inserted into register calls, the preceding `phone:` line was left without a trailing comma, and `emergencyContactPhone` got a double `,,`.

**Files fixed:** `e2e-api-extended.ts` (4 places), `e2e-api-negative.ts` (2 places), `e2e-api-coverage.ts` (1 place).

## v2.1.0 — Build 122 · 2026-06-01 · Session 6

---

### Feature — Frontend boarding UI
**File:** `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/rides/[id]/page.tsx`

**Giver — ONGOING state:**
- Participant list now shows `boardingStatus` badge per seeker (WAITING / BOARDED / DEBOARDED / NO_SHOW)
- "No Show" button appears per WAITING seeker; calls `PATCH /rides/:id/no-show/:seekerId`
- "Complete Ride" button is disabled (locked) until every participant is DEBOARDED or NO_SHOW
- Hover title explains why it's locked

**Seeker — ONGOING state:**
- `WAITING` → "🚗 I've Boarded" button; calls `PATCH /rides/:id/board`
- `BOARDED` → "✅ I've Arrived" button; calls `PATCH /rides/:id/deboard`
- `DEBOARDED` / `NO_SHOW` → read-only status chip

**API client additions** (`apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`):
```ts
ridesApi.board(id)              // PATCH /rides/:id/board
ridesApi.deboard(id)            // PATCH /rides/:id/deboard
ridesApi.markNoShow(rideId, seekerUserId)  // PATCH /rides/:id/no-show/:seekerId
```

---

## v2.1.0 — Build 115 · 2026-06-01 · Session 5

### Architecture — TRID membership system
- New field `trid String? @unique` on `User` model
- Format: `TR2000`, `TR2001`, ... — sequential, assigned on admin verification approval
- Start number controlled by `TRID_START` constant in `packages/shared/src/constants.ts` **and** `constants.js`
- Welcome email sent to `personalEmail` (if set) or `email` on approval
- Shown as branded member card on profile page (`/profile`)

**Where it's generated:** `verification.service.ts → review()` — uses `prisma.user.count({ where: { trid: { not: null } } })` as the sequence. Not atomic — avoid concurrent approvals.

---

### Architecture — Boarding lifecycle
New `boardingStatus` field on `RideParticipant` (enum: `WAITING / BOARDED / DEBOARDED / NO_SHOW`).

**State machine:**
```
WAITING → board() → BOARDED → deboard() → DEBOARDED
WAITING → markNoShow() → NO_SHOW
```

**Auto-start:** when ALL confirmed participants have boarded, the ride auto-starts (no manual giver action needed).

**Complete gate:** `complete()` is blocked if any participant is still `WAITING` or `BOARDED`. Giver must use "No Show" for non-boarders.

**No-show side effects:** restores 1 available seat, deducts 10 ECO points from seeker, sends in-app notification + email.

---

### Architecture — Dual email routing
```
Auth emails (verify, reset, OTP)  → user.email (official/company)
Ride notifications, TRID welcome  → user.personalEmail ?? user.email
```
`EmailService.sendNotification()` handles the routing. Use it for all non-auth emails.

---

### Schema additions (migration: `db push`)
| Field | Model | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `trid` | User | `String? @unique` | TR2000+ |
| `personalEmail` | User | `String?` | Any domain — notifications only |
| `bloodGroup` | User | `String?` | Optional |
| `homeLocation` | User | `String` | Required at signup |
| `officeLocation` | User | `String` | Required at signup |
| `emergencyContactName` | User | `String` | Required at signup |
| `emergencyContactPhone` | User | `String` | Required at signup |
| `boardingStatus` | RideParticipant | Enum | WAITING default |
| `boardedAt` | RideParticipant | `DateTime?` | Set on board() |
| `deboaredAt` | RideParticipant | `DateTime?` | Typo in schema — keep for now to avoid migration |

> ⚠️ `deboaredAt` is a typo (should be `deboaredAt` → `deboaredAt`). Do not fix without a proper migration — `db push --accept-data-loss` will lose data.

---

### Signup — 4-step flow
1. Account (email, password, name, gender)
2. Work & Contact (company, phone, personalEmail?, bloodGroup?)
3. Location & Emergency (homeLocation, officeLocation, emergencyContact*)
4. Role (RIDE_GIVER / RIDE_SEEKER / BOTH)

All new fields are validated at `POST /auth/register`. Old test helpers needed updating — all fixed in commit `cc86988`.

---

### Removed — 15-min hold timer
`SEAT_HOLD_TTL_SECONDS` constant kept for reference but hold logic removed from `ride-requests.service.ts`. `approve()` no longer sets `holdExpiresAt`. Seekers can confirm at any time after approval.

If you see any Redis `hold:*` keys, they're harmless leftovers.

---

### New endpoints
| Method | Path | Guard | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PATCH` | `/rides/:id/board` | Seeker (confirmed) | Mark self BOARDED |
| `PATCH` | `/rides/:id/deboard` | Seeker (BOARDED) | Mark self DEBOARDED |
| `PATCH` | `/rides/:id/no-show/:seekerId` | Giver (ride owner) | Mark seeker NO_SHOW |
| `PATCH` | `/rides/:id/edit` | Giver (ride owner) | Edit PUBLISHED ride |

---

## v2.0.4 — Build 112 · 2026-06-01 · Session 4

### Playwright E2E — P0 security tests
- `tests/e2e/permission-leaks.spec.ts` — 24 tests covering role boundary leaks (seeker acting as giver, etc.)
- `tests/e2e/verification-bypass.spec.ts` — 6 tests covering document upload bypass attempts
- `playwright.config.ts` — reads `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` env var; falls back to `http://localhost:3000`

### Email delivery — Resend
- `RESEND_API_KEY` set on Render
- `EMAIL_FROM=onboarding@resend.dev` (temporary — domain not yet verified)
- End-to-end verified: register → verification email → click link → verified → login
- `gmail.com` added to `allowed-domains.ts` for testing — **REMOVE before production**

### Auth — `gh` CLI
- Authenticated as `snrdigitalmarketingindia-web` on CI runner
- Used for CI auto-fix workflow (`ci-autofix.yml`) — creates/closes GitHub Issues on failure

---

## v2.0.3 — Build 95 · 2026-06-01 · Session 3

### QA audit — 15 API bugs fixed
| Bug | File | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Unverified giver could publish rides | `rides.service.ts` | Added `verificationStatus` guard |
| RC not checked on publish | `rides.service.ts` | Added `rcVerified` guard |
| Race condition — double seat booking | `ride-requests.service.ts` | Atomic conditional decrement with `updateMany` |
| Seeker could approve own request | `ride-requests.service.ts` | Role + ownership check |
| Admin could be self-registered | `auth.service.ts` | Blocked ADMIN role in register |
| Giver could delete vehicle in active ride | `vehicles.service.ts` | Added active ride check |
| Duplicate plate number → 500 | `vehicles.service.ts` | Caught P2002 → 409 |
| Cancel too close to departure | `rides.service.ts` | >1 hour rule enforced |
| Edit with active seekers | `rides.service.ts` | Added participant check |
| ... (15 total) | | |

### Test coverage
6 suites, 320 automated checks. All green at end of session 3.

### `ci-autofix.yml`
Workflow that triggers on CI failure → reads test output → opens a GitHub Issue with failure details. Closes the issue automatically when CI passes again.

---

## v2.0.2 — Build 65 · 2026-06-01 · Session 2

### Business rules (all API-enforced)
- One active ride per giver (PUBLISHED or ONGOING → 400 on new publish)
- One active request per seeker (PENDING/HOLD/CONFIRMED → 409)
- BOTH-role users cannot request their own ride

### Test suites
- `tests/e2e-api.ts` — 37 tests, full lifecycle
- `tests/e2e-api-extended.ts` — 30 tests, edge cases
- `tests/e2e-api-negative.ts` — 30 tests, error paths
- `tests/e2e-api-business-rules.ts` — 44 tests, rule enforcement

### CI pipeline
- `ci.yml` — PostgreSQL + Redis services, seed, start API, run all suites, Playwright
- Matrix: Node 24, Ubuntu latest
- Artifacts: `api-log` uploaded on failure

---

## v2.0.1 — Build 1 · 2026-05-01 · Session 1

### Initial scaffold
- NestJS API (monorepo `apps/api`) with Prisma + PostgreSQL
- Next.js 14 frontend (monorepo `apps/web`)
- Shared package `packages/shared` — enums, types, constants
- Deployed: API → Render, Frontend → Vercel, DB → Neon, Cache → Upstash Redis
- Auth: JWT access (15m) + refresh (7d), email verification via Resend
- Core modules: Auth, Users, Rides, RideRequests, Vehicles, Verification, Gamification, Notifications, Admin, SOS, LiveTracking

---

## Architecture — Quick Reference

### Module map
```
apps/api/src/modules/
├── auth/           JWT auth, register, login, email verify, password reset
├── users/          Profile, emergency contacts
├── rides/          Ride CRUD + lifecycle (publish/start/board/deboard/complete/cancel)
├── ride-requests/  Request lifecycle (create/approve/confirm/reject/cancel)
├── vehicles/       Vehicle CRUD, RC verification
├── verification/   Document submission + admin review + TRID assignment
├── gamification/   ECO points, levels, leaderboard
├── notifications/  In-app notification store
├── admin/          User management, analytics, verification queue
├── sos/            Emergency SOS broadcast
└── live-tracking/  GPS position via Redis (WebSocket)
```

### Key invariants
- `availableSeats` is decremented at **approve time** (not confirm), restored on cancel/reject/no-show
- `trid` is set at **approve time** by admin, never changes
- `boardingStatus` starts as `WAITING` when seeker is added to `RideParticipant`
- Redis hold keys (`hold:rideId:seekerId`) are legacy — hold timer removed in v2.1.0
- `packages/shared/src/*.js` must be kept in sync with `*.ts` manually until build is wired up
